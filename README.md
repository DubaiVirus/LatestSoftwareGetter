# SoftwareDownloader

A small tool that you can use to store software names with their download link. Then you can download the software with just pressing a button.
this comes in handy in situations like a fresh installation of Windows.

The download details are saved in a config.xml file in %ProgramData%foreignWay\SoftwareDownloader\config.xaml

I've included a a sample file in this Repo.

Enjoy!
